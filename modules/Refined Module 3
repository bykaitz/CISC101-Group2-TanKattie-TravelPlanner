Create a short list of candidate activities (e.g., attractions, restaurants, parks). Each activity must include: type, estimated duration, cost range, and distance.

Use a simple loop to build days:

for each day:

Morning (8:00–12:00)

Pick up to 2 activities near lodging.

If no attractions are available, suggest a location that does not depend on opening hours (e.g., public park).

If outdoor weather is unsafe (e.g., thunderstorm, heavy rain), suggest an indoor activity instead.

Midday (12:00–15:00)

Pick up to 2 nearby attractions or lunch options.

If none are available, suggest a flexible option such as a public square or park.

If outdoor weather is unsafe, suggest an indoor alternative.

Afternoon (15:00–18:00)

Pick up to 2 activities with a different theme (e.g., cultural, scenic, shopping).

If no attractions are available, suggest a public space or walkable area not dependent on hours.

If outdoor weather is unsafe, suggest an indoor activity.

Evening (18:00–22:00)

Pick up to 2 restaurants or optional events.

If no suitable venue is available, suggest a casual option such as a local food market or open promenade.

If outdoor weather is unsafe, suggest indoor dining or entertainment.
